# iubendacookiesolution-multilangual
Create your multilangual cookie solution banner in vanilla JS

Reads the value of the <HTML> tag attribute "lang" and changes the Cookie Solution Script dinamically 

You should create your own CS scripts in your dashboard, then you should:

<!-- replace XXX1 with the site_id from your specific iubenda embed code -->
<!-- replace XXX2 with the policy_id from your EN iubenda embed code -->
<!-- replace XXX3 with the policy_id from your IT iubenda embed code -->

Please don't forget to merge all your specific parameter in the demo script to have the same look and feel of your banner
